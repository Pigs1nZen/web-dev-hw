  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <br />
  <p>One reason I enjoy this class is that aside from being beneficial towards my future, it also allows me the freedom to express myself, which is why I chose skateboarding! Although I don't skate nearly as much as I used to it will always be one of my favorite sports. Everyday after school it was the same routine: go and skate at the park for 4-5 hours, or skate at my friend's house for 4-5 hours. I remember when first learning at like 9 it took me three weeks til I was able to pop my first Ollie. It's incredibly frustrating but what a rewarding feeling! Although it took what felt like forever to learn it, the Ollie takes a lifetime to perfect. Even though they're as basic of a trick as it gets, they are also one of the toughest to perform. But once it's learned it's hard to forget.
