  <h1>How to do an Ollie</h1>
  <h3>By: Colin Smith</h3>
  <p>Invented by Alan <q>Ollie</q> Gelfand in the late 1970s, the Ollie is one of the first tricks a skateboarder will learn, and is essential in order to master the extreme sport. Since its inception, the Ollie has completely changed the direction of skateboarding into the sport we now know today.
  </p>
    <br />
  <p>
  <q><i>Alan did an ollie like no other person. No one to this day has done ollies like him, and if you saw him back then it was so effortless and no one could copy that. He was definitely an original. An originator.</i></q>- Craig Snyder, Author of <i>A Secret History of the Ollie, Volume 1: the 1970s</i>
