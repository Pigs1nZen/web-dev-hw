<h2>Jane Says</h2>
<h3>Jane's Addiction</h3>

<hr />

<p>Jane goes to the store at 8</p>
<p>She walks up on St. Andrew's</p>
<p>She waits and gets her dinner there</p>
<p>She pulls her dinner from her pocket</p>
<p>Jane says I ain't never been in love</p>
<p>I don't know what it is</p>
<p>She only knows if someone wants her</p>
