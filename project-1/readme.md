# My Readme

I typically use Safari whenever using the internet since I am using a Mac. However, given that it does not support GitHub's demands well enough alone, I find Firefox to be much more reliable.

When requesting to visit a website using a web browser information is sent to the network, which then responds with a collection of HTMLs, CSSs, JPGs and PNGs.

When visiting the UM website using the Wayback Machine I went back to the first screenshot recorded on Feb. 19, 1997. At first glance, the home of the site is quite small, offering only links, and a friendly "Welcome!" and no home information. Nevertheless, I wouldn't be able to design such a website just yet, but the technicalities appear to be pretty straight-forward regarding HTML and CSS. I also appreciate how they provided information for developing their website, along with all of their resources.

## Work Cycle
Now that I am more familiar with GitHub and Atom, developing this webpage was much easier and way less stressful than last weeks assignment, other than the one small hiccup in the process. In which case, continuing project-1 through Firefox was more reliable.
