# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo

## Colin Smith

Enrolling in this course grants me the opportunity of learning the fundamentals of web development and its components, including HTML and CSS. With this course and all it has to offer I hope to expand my knowledge of web and internet basics in order to build a stronger resume for potential careers in the near future. As we are moving closer to a more digitalized era, being well-informed and experienced in the process of coding and webpage development appears to almost be a requirement. I believe that being a part of this Intro to Web Design course will help me pave the way towards becoming a more proficient student as well as potential employee, given all that I will learn this semester.

**What is the Internet?**

I was under the impression that the World Wide Web and the internet were the same when in fact they're not. The web is just the acquirement of information via the internet, while the internet is the source of information.

 I was also aware that HTML was the linguistics of web development, however I had not heard of CSS, and am anxious to start the designing portion of this course.

 Echoing what Justine quoted, the fact that the accessibility of every other web page is a mere 19 clicks away (on average) is astounding to me. Something I had never even considered but am blown away about.
